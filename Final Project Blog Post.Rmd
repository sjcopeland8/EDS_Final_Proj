# Neglected Tropical Diseases

```{r include = FALSE}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(include = FALSE)
```


```{r include = FALSE}
library(prettydoc)
library(arsenal)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(tidyr)
library(DescTools)
library(tibble)
library(calecopal)
library(ggeffects)
library(gt)
library(plotly)
library(viridis)
library(hrbrthemes)
```

## A New Output Format

`html_pretty` in the
[**prettydoc**](https://github.com/yixuan/prettydoc/) package is a new
output format for creating HTML documents from R Markdown files.
`html_pretty` is more lightweight compared to `html_document`, and is
more stylish than `html_vignette` when creating package vignettes.

## New Styles

`html_pretty` currently supports three page themes (`cayman`, `tactile`
and `architect`), and two syntax highlight styles (`github` and
`vignette`). The theme and highlight styles can be specified in the
document metadata, for example:

``` {.yaml}
output:
  prettydoc::html_pretty:
    theme: architect
    highlight: github
```

## Your Familiar Tools

Feel free to use the `knitr` infrastructure with dozens of tunable
options in your document.

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
n <- 1000
x1  <- matrix(rnorm(n), ncol = 2)
x2  <- matrix(rnorm(n, mean = 3, sd = 1.5), ncol = 2)
x   <- rbind(x1, x2)
#head(x)
smoothScatter(x, xlab = "x1", ylab = "x2")
```

You can include code snippets of languages other than R, but note that
the block header has no curly brackets around the language name.

``` {.cpp}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector timesTwo(NumericVector x) {
    return x * 2;
}
```

You can also write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$,
footnotes[^1], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

[^1]: A footnote here.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(iris, 10))
```
